Compare and exchange contained value (weak)

Compares the contents of the atomic object's contained value with expected:
- if true, it replaces the contained value with val (like store).
- if false, it replaces expected with the contained value .

The function always accesses the contained value to read it, and -if the comparison is true- it then also replaces it. But the entire operation is atomic: the value cannot be modified by other threads between the instant its value is read and the moment it is replaced.

The memory order used in (2) depends on the result of the comparison: if true, it uses success; if false, it uses failure.

Note that this function compares directly the physical contents of the contained value with the contents of expected; This may result in failed comparisons for values that compare equal using operator== (if the underlying type has padding bits, trap values, or alternate representations of the same value), although this comparison shall converge rapidly in a loop that preserves expected.

Unlike compare_exchange_strong, this weak version is allowed to fail spuriously by returning false even when expected indeed compares equal to the contained object. This may be acceptable behavior for certain looping algorithms, and may lead to significantly better performance on some platforms. On these spurious failures, the function returns false while not modifying expected.

```
// atomic::compare_exchange_weak example:
#include <iostream>       // std::cout
#include <atomic>         // std::atomic
#include <thread>         // std::thread
#include <vector>         // std::vector

// a simple global linked list:
struct Node { int value; Node* next; };
std::atomic<Node*> list_head (nullptr);

void append (int val) {     // append an element to the list
  Node* oldHead = list_head;
  Node* newNode = new Node {val,oldHead};

  // what follows is equivalent to: list_head = newNode, but in a thread-safe way:
  while (!list_head.compare_exchange_weak(oldHead,newNode))
    newNode->next = oldHead;
}

int main ()
{
  // spawn 10 threads to fill the linked list:
  std::vector<std::thread> threads;
  for (int i=0; i<10; ++i) threads.push_back(std::thread(append,i));
  for (auto& th : threads) th.join();

  // print contents:
  for (Node* it = list_head; it!=nullptr; it=it->next)
    std::cout << ' ' << it->value;
  std::cout << '\n';

  // cleanup:
  Node* it; while (it=list_head) {list_head=it->next; delete it;}

  return 0;
}
